## Development and Contributions
+ The plugin was developed by [2GLux.com](2GLux.com) for Joomla 2.5 and 3 with the original plugin name "Sexy Polling".
+ After the "Sexy Polling" was removed from the web and the support was canceled, a fork of the plugin was migrated to Joomla 4 with the new plugin name "Sexy Polling Reloaded" by [Jefferson49](https://github.com/Jefferson49)
+ Further contributions on [Github](https://github.com/Jefferson49/Joomla_sexypolling_reloaded) are welcome!
